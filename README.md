1) Overview

The Weather App provides a clean, interactive dashboard that shows:
	•	Current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and “feels-like” readings
	•	3-day weather forecast with icons and conditions
	•	°C/°F toggle and automatic day/night theme

💡 Goal: Strengthen Python skills in API requests, JSON parsing, UI layout, and modular class design.
